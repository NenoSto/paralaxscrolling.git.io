      <h2 class="heading">Bourse at Antwerp Catedral</h2>
      <p><b><u>The Bourse of Antwerp</u></b> (Handelsbeurs), Belgium. Between 1531 and 1997, it was “the mother of all stock exchanges”, as it’s the world's first purpose-built commodity and stock exchange.
        From the end of the 15th century, Bruges’ importance as an international hub declined and in 1531, Antwerp took over the role as commercial center.
        In the 16th century, Antwerp grew into a large metropolis with more than 100,000 inhabitants. From 1531 they were given a new building in Brabant's late Gothic style. For half a century, this Bourse would be the focal point of European trade and the model for cities with similar ambitions. After a fire in 1583, the exchange was immediately rebuilt according to the same plans.
        Then came the The Siege of Antwerp (1584-1585) and the surrender to the 'Spanish' Army of Flanders. It completely impoverished commercial life. Between 1661 and 1810, the building was used as a drawing academy and seat of the Guild of Saint Luke.
        The open interior space was given a progressive dome in 1853 by Charles Marcellis, modeled on London's CrystalPalace.
        When a second fire in August 1858 destroyed the building again, the Antwerp city council organized a competition in which the old concept had to be preserved. Marcellis again submitted a design, but the current building was finally completed in 1872 by architect Joseph Schadde.
        It’s a curious combination of the historicizing #NeoGothic style and revolutionary techniques, especially the metal construction for the dome of the interior space.
        The Antwerp stock exchange was abolished at the end of 1997 and taken over by the Brussels stock exchange. After 20 years of falling into disrepair, it has been beautifully restored and functions as an event venue, with talks of it becoming a luxurious hotel.<br>

      <h2 class="heading">Cologne Cathedral</h2>
      <p><u><b>Cologne Cathedral</b></u> (Kölner dom) is a Gothic cathedral in the center of the German city of Cologne and is the largest cathedral in Germany. Starting in 1248, the cathedral and its distinctive towers were finally completed in 1880 in NeoGothic style. Only the lowest part of the west tower is from the 13th century.
        In 1164, Archbishop Rainald van Dassel brought relics of the Holy Three Kings from Italy to Cologne. After this, the church was immediately one of the most important pilgrim churches in Europe. Because it was felt that these pilgrims should be able to come to a worthy church, it was decided in 1225 to replace the old cathedral with a new building in the then modern FrenchGothic
        On August 15 1248, under the direction of master builder Gerhard von Rile, the construction of the new cathedral started. They started with the eastern part, modeled on #AmiensCathedra
        However, at the end of the 15th century, construction stagnated due to reduced trade and a reduced number of pilgrims. Lack of money and lack of interest eventually led to a complete halt in 1528.
        Between 1744-1770, a #Baroque refurbishment took place. When revolutionary troops invaded #Cologne in 1794, during the French occupation, the archbishop fled and the building was damaged, even used as a stable for the French army.
        When the cathedral was reconsecrated as a church building, enthusiasm for the completion grew. In 1880 the towers were finally completed and with it the construction of the entire #cathedral, following the construction plans from the MiddleAges.
        The cathedral suffered 14 hits by aerial bombs during WWII. It nevertheless remained standing in an otherwise completely flattened city. The twin spires were an easily recognizable navigational landmark for Allied aircraft bombing.

      <h2 class="heading">Aachen Cathedral</h2>
      <p><u><b>Aachen Cathedral </b></u> (Aachener Dom), Germany. To discribe its complicated but extremely fascinating history here would be difficult, but here's an attempt for a very short summary:
        The current building originated from the court church of the one and only Charlemagne, king of the Frank's and the first emperor of the #HolyRomanEmpire. The octagonal section, the Palatine Chapel, which now functions as the center of the building, was built between 796 and 804 after #Byzantine examples. Charlemagne was buried here in 814 and, yes, you can visit his grave there still today!
        During the 881 Viking attacks, the chapel got severely damaged and was not restored until 983.
        After Charlemagne was canonized in 1165, a stream of pelgrims started to visit the church. For this reason, a Gothic choir hall and a two-part "Capella vitrea" (glass chapel) were built in 1355. The dome, some chapels and the tower were added at later dates.
        During WWII, the cathedral was one of the few known German buildings to remain largely undamaged, which is a really really fantastic thing!
        The cathedral has left such a large impact on European architecture throughout European history, that is served as an inspiration many times. Most notably, #SainteChapelle in Paris! French king Louis IX was keen to exploit in presenting himself as a worthy successor to the first Holy Roman Emperor.<br>

          <h2 class="heading">Gravensteen Castle</h2>
          <p>The Gravensteen (literally translated "Castle of the Counts") is a medieval castle at Ghent, East Flanders in Belgium. The current castle dates from 1180 and was the residence of the Counts of Flanders until 1353. It was subsequently re-purposed as a court, prison, mint, and even as a cotton factory. It was restored over 1893–1903 and is now a museum and a major landmark in the city.<br>
